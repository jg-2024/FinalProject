The Sleepy Sheep Rest Tracker GUI allows the user to input a nap, nighttime rest, and/or generate a report.

To start, run the program.



Then you will click on one of three buttons.

1) Log Nap: Lets you choose a date, input how many hours you slept for, and rate your sleep. When rating your sleep, 1 is the worst. 5 is the best. Each number corresponds with an appropriate emoji. 

2) Log Sleep: Lets you choose a date, input how many hours you slept for, and rate your sleep. When rating your sleep, 1 is the worst. 5 is the best. Each number corresponds with an appropriate emoji. 

3) Generate Rest Report: Opens a window that shows how many times you input sleep and nap data along with various totals and averages of 	that data including averages for the previous seven inputs. If you were to input data for every day, the average would be for the week.



If you log a nap or sleep, you must follow the correct format for data and click "Save and Close" when you're done in order for all data to recorded properly. If you leave a field blank or input the incorrect data, an error message pops up.

To delete data, open the "sleep.txt" file, delete its contents, and save it.
